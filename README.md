### 3. HackUPC 2024 - Inditex TECH Challenge
- **Overview**: Developed a solution to detect duplicate or similar images in a dataset, a clothing recommendation system based on the outfit provided by the user, and an assistant system to manage out-of-stock problems for Inditex. Utilized the pre-trained model CLIP for understanding image context and semantic segmentation with a U-NET model for detecting and segmenting clothes in images.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Pytorch, Huggingface, CLIP, U-NET, Semantic Segmentation
- **Key Highlights**: Image Embedding, Contextual Understanding, Clothing Recommendation, Semantic Segmentation, FrontEnd
