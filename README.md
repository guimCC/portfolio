### Featured Projects

#### 1. CriminalMap
- **Overview**: Developed a crime mapping app using **Python** and **C**. Implemented **A\* algorithm** variation
for pathfinding. When computing the best route between two points, it takes in account **real time crime
data** in order to suggest the fastest & safest route.
- **Technologies Used**:  Python, C, Overpass API, Selenium + BeautifulSoup, Google Maps API, Matplotlib
- **Key Highlights**: : Algorithm Design (A*), Data Flow, Data Parsing, Geospatial Analysis, Data Visualization, Web
scraping.

#### 2. NovartisDatathon 2023
- **Overview**: Developed a **ML model** for **forecasting** a company's sales in the healthcare industry. Focused on **Time Series Analysis** for extracting information of time-dependent features such as trends, seasons,... 
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, LightGBM, Latitude
- **[Currently private](GitHub link)**
- **Key Highlights**: Time Series Forecasting, Data cleaning, Lag features, Rolling Features, Feature engineering, LightGBM model

#### 2. Datathon FME 2023 - Outfit generator
- **Overview**: In the Datathon FME 2023, our team developed an innovative **AI tool** that recommends outfits aligning with a brand's core philosophy. The challenge was to integrate diverse data types - from **tabular data** to **image features**. Our solution involved merging product data with **features** extracted using a **Convolutional Neural Network** (CNN), feeding this rich dataset into a **Transformer model** to generate brand-aligned outfit suggestions.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook
- **Key Highlights**: Data cleaning, Data preprocessing, Feature extraction, Dimensionality reduction, Fill-in-the-blank, Convolutional Neural Networks, Transformer model, Deep learning
